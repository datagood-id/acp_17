## Illustration

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

-   A group of researchers in Indonesia were interested in looking at how well social relationship and/or health predicted happiness
-   The study included more than 72,000 respondents, and differences in happiness mean scores were estimated using linear regression.
-   The results found that level of social relationship health did predict happiness significantly

## What is prediction?

The basic idea is to use a set of previously collected data (such as data on variables X and Y), calculate how correlated these variables are with one another, and then use that correlation and the knowledge of X to predict Y.

## Example

-   A researcher collects data on total high school grade point average (GPA) and first-year university GPA for 400 students in their freshman year at the state university.
-   He computes the correlation between the two variables. Then, he uses the techniques you'll learn about later in this chapter to take a new set of high school GPAs and (knowing the relationship between high school GPA and first-year college GPA from the previous set of students) predict what first-year GPA should be for a new sample of 400 students.

## The logic of prediction

-   Prediction is the computation of future outcomes based on a knowledge of present ones.
-   When we want to predict one variable from another, we need to first compute the correlation between the two variables.

## Basic formula of regression

$$
y=bX+a
$$

-   y is the predicted score of Y based on a known value of X,
-   b is the slope of the line,
-   X is the score being used as the predictor, and
-   a is the point at which the line crosses the y-axis.

## Detailed formula

$$
b = \frac{{\Sigma{XY}}-(\Sigma{X}\Sigma{Y}/n)}{\Sigma{X^2}-[(\Sigma{X})^2)/n]}
$$

$$
a=\frac{\Sigma{Y}-b\Sigma{X}}{n}
$$

## Entry data

```{r, echo=TRUE}
hs_gpa <- c(3.50, 2.50, 4.00, 3.80, 2.80, 1.90, 3.20, 3.70, 2.70, 3.30)
u_gpa <- c(3.30, 2.20, 3.50,  2.70, 3.50, 2.00, 3.10, 3.40, 1.90, 3.70)
gpa <- data.frame(hs_gpa, u_gpa) 
```

## calculate the components

```{r,echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
gpa<-gpa %>% mutate(hs_gpa_hat=hs_gpa^2) %>%
  mutate(u_gpa_hat=u_gpa^2) %>%
  mutate(hsXu=hs_gpa*u_gpa) 
gpa
```

## Early Table

## Calculate b

```{r, echo=TRUE}
sum_hs=sum(hs_gpa)
sum_u=sum(u_gpa)
sum_hs_hat=sum(hs_gpa)^2
sum_hs_gpa_hat=sum(gpa$hs_gpa_hat)
sum_hs_u=sum(gpa$hsXu)

sum_hs
sum_hs_hat
sum_u
sum_hs_gpa_hat
sum_hs_u
```

## calculate b

$$
b=\frac{{\Sigma{XY}}-(\Sigma{X}.\Sigma{Y}/n)}{\Sigma{X^2}-[(\Sigma{X})^2)/n]}
$$

```{r, echo=TRUE}
n <- 10
b <- (sum_hs_u-(sum_hs*sum_u)/n) / ((sum_hs_gpa_hat-(sum_hs_hat)/n))
b
```

## calculate a

$$
a=\frac{\Sigma{Y}-b\Sigma{X}}{n}
$$

```{r,echo=TRUE}
a <- (sum_u - b*sum_hs)/n
a
```

## calculate y

$$
y=bX+a
$$

```{r,echo=TRUE}
y <- b*3.5 + a
y
```
